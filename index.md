### Short Bio about Me:
Hello to the good, the bad, and the beautiful people,

Welcome to my page, you have now reached the end of the internet and if you somehow made it here by mistake, it's not too late to hit the `X` in the corner before you get submerged. So a little 'bit' or a 'byte' about me, I make cornball jokes! Oh, and I like to break into things most people claim secure, without malice, for the challenge. If you prefer, you can address me by one of the many handles that I mask my identity with and change almost as often as my underwear. My full-story will soon be available when my new book gets published in 'Nevuary'. Where I am from they might say something like "Game is sold, not told". Unless it's about a hack cause that's the type of knowledge too juicy to withhold!

## Write-ups
This is where I will be posting my write-ups for my digital adventures on [Hack the box](https://hackthebox.eu)
