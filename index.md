### Short Bio about Me:
Hi,

My government name is Justen pronounced "Just 10" and I like to break into things, legally of course! Prison is cold and dangerious, my office is warm and mostly safe. If you prefer you can address me by one of the many handles that I mask my identity with and change almost as often as my underware, that's cool with me too. I Have been debating if I should disclose my full-story but maybe I will save that for my book. The game is meant to be sold, not told. Unless it's about hacking stuff cause that type of knowledge is too juicy to withold and needs to be shared!
