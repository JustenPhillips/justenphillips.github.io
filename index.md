### About Me
Hi,

My name is Justen(pronounced:Jus-10) Phillips, if you want, you can just call me Jay-Jay like my family or one of the various other awesome handles that I mask my identity with, that seems to change more often than my underwear. Resided most of my 31 years spinning around this floating rock coordinated in the Foothills of Oakland,California, where I get to master my all-time favorite past-time. Legally, breaking into places that originally didn't intend to for me to be. I began hacking as teenager working as an apprentice Automobile locksmith for one of the largest Auto Auctions in California, picking complex locks, physically hacking into ECM and flashing firmware to bypass Car system Security. After losing my Locksmith license over a bogus charge I caught for someone I once called friend, I adventured outside of the Electronic realm. Then went back to school, which eventually made a full circle back into Security. My current daily 9 to 5 role is now working as a Cyber Security Analyst for a reputable international cooperation providing a hacker's perspective on monitoring their SOC for fraudulent activity over the wire, hunting for threats while protecting their digital assets from unauthorized access. When I get free time I take part in capture the Flag competitions. So that I might not forget and keep track of the effort put forth I put this page together to share with others and myself the valuable lessons learned from these challenges.
