### Short Bio about Me:
Hi,

My name is Justen(pronounced:Jus-10) Phillips, if you want, you can just call me Jay-Jay like my family or one of the various other awesome handles that I mask my identity with, that seems to change more often than my underwear. Resided most of my 31 years spinning around this floating rock coordinated in Silicon Valley's armpit somewhere in the Foothills of East Side Oakland,California, right Accross the bay from San Fransisco. Here I got to master my all-time favorite past-time. Legally, breaking into places that originally didn't intend for me to be. As I began hacking as teenager working as a apprentice Automobile locksmith for one of the largest Auto Auctions in California I became a master Locksmith, picking complex locks for various models manufactures, physically hacking into ECM and flashing firmware to bypass Car system Security. After losing my Locksmith license over a bogus charge I caught for doing a favor for a false friend, lien to the police, I adventured outside of the Electronic realm as a union laborer for 7 years. Where I eventually went back to school and got a degree in Computer Information Systems with a emphasis in Security. My current daily 9 to 5 role is now working as a Cyber Security Analyst for a reputable international cooperation providing a hacker's perspective on monitoring their SOC controls for fraudulent activity over the wire, hunting for threats while protecting their digital assets from unauthorized access. When I get free time between being a father,I take on freelance penetration testing contracts and practice my craft through capture the Flag competitions. So that I might not forget and keep track of the effort put forth, I put this page together to share with others and myself the valuable lessons learned from these challenges.
