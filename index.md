### Short Bio about Me:
Hello to the good, the bad, and the beautiful people reading my page,

Welcome to my page, you have now reached the end of the internet and if you somehow made it here by mistake, it's not too late to hit the `X` in the corner before you are submerged. So a little bit or a byte about me, I make cornball jokes! Oh, and I like to break into things most people claim to be secured, without malice, for the challenge. If you prefer, you can address me by one of the many handles that I mask my identity with and change almost as often as my underwear. My full-story will soon be available when my new book gets released in Nevuary. Where I am from they might say something like "The game is meant to be sold, not told." Unless it's about hacking cause that's the type of knowledge too juicy to withhold and needs to be shared to all!
