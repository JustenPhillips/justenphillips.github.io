### Short Bio about Me:
Hello to the good, the bad, and the beautiful people reading my page,

Welcome to my page, you have now reached the end of the internet and if you somehow made it here by mistake, it's not too late to hit the X in the corner before you are submerged. So a little bit about me, I like to break into things most people claim to be secure, ethically of course. If you prefer, you can address me by one of the many handles that I mask my identity with and change almost as often as my underwear. I Have been debating if I should disclose my full-story here, but maybe I will save that for my book released in Nevuary. The game is meant to be sold, not told. Unless it's about hacking stuff cause that type of knowledge is too juicy to withhold and needs to be shared!
