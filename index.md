### About Me
Hi,
My name is Justen(pronounced:Jus-10) and you can just call me Jay-Jay or one of the various awesome handles that I mask my identity with, that seems to change more often than my underware. I am a lover not a fighter but will fight for what I love, and I don't have friends, only family, don't do friendemies. I resided most of my time spinning around on this floating rock corodinated within the Foothills of Oaktown,Ca born in 1988 and since the chaos of the mid 1990s and hyphy all through the 2000s until the golden age of today, 2020, the chill-period. Where I get to master my all-time favorite past-time in breaking into places that I wasn't originally indetend to be.
