# BankRobber

This was my first active box on HTB that I was able to root, and it's rated at an insane difficulty. So I thought this would be a great place to start for my first write-up. 

Took me about a week of late night excursions in total isolation and focus until I was able to pop it. It's not easy for me to attain free-time due to my obligated daily responsibilities. So sleep was limited but I was very determined to get this one.

I liked this box a lot because it consisted of vulnerabilites that I already knew how to find and exploit as I was trained by Security Consultants and Senior Penetration Testers to do so. Only issue I had was this box required a bot to inpersonate a admin's session and the response time for this was just not there, which was a major detourant and took me a while to notice, almost to the point that I gave up. After I got over that mountain and seen a reaction from my script, I was able to get inital foothold and eventually root it within a few days.

### Reconnaissance

Well, before any PT, you first must know what is the scope of the engagement. What do we already know, we know that this is a Windows host from the description card and HTB provided the IP address of our target. So we turn to `nmap` a faithful and reliable tool that is almost as old as the internet itself. Then initate a scan and probe all common TCP ports to discover some services to test.
```bash
# nmap -e tun0 -n -v -Pn -p80,443,445,3306 -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.154
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE      REASON          VERSION

```
We see here that HTTP/s web services are available at standard ports 80 and 443, a MYSQL database on standard 3306 as well as a open port on 445 standard SMB which is another way to determine the likelyness this is a Windows machine.

Since the name of the challenge is BankRobber, I think it is pretty safe to assume their is a bank involved.
Before looking at the network stack I always begin with the application layer. So I load up my HTTP proxy/sniffer/injector/fuzzer Burp Suite,the swiss army knife of HTTP testing and surf over to the web site to have a look-see at this Bank's applications and see what she is made of.

So we see here that this is some kind of BitCoin operation. Let's learn more...

#### Directory/File Enumeration

First I spider with Burp to crawl unauthenticated to build a basic site-map.

While in my terminal I run `Gobuster` with `Seclists`
```bash

`login.php` and `register.php` both have a input fields to test later.

The `/admin` dir is not accessible, session managment will be tested.

`notes.txt` provided some Dev notes left behind.

let's do a HTTP packet analysis of the `.php` files with `curl`

`login.php`

```bash
# curl -i -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://10.10.10.154/login.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:49:55 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Location: index.php
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```
`register.php`

```bash
# curl -i -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://10.10.10.154/register.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:51:16 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Location: index.php?msg=User already exists.
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```
We can now see that users can be enumerated by `msg=User already exist` 
and we identifed an account with the username `admin` 

let's see what happens if we create a user that dosn't exist.
```bash
# curl -i -d "username=mother&password=goose" http://10.10.10.154/register.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:53:48 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Location: index.php?msg=User created.
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Now let's try to login.
```bash
 # curl -i -d "username=mother&password=goose" http://10.10.10.154/login.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:55:08 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Set-Cookie: id=25
Set-Cookie: username=ZGlwc2hpdA%3D%3D
Set-Cookie: password=ZGlwc2hpdA%3D%3D
Location: user
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```
The response headers here tells us a lot about the authentication mechanisms in place.

`Location: user` indicates redirection to the `/user` dir 
we can assume admin should get redirected to `/admin`

cookie-based authentication
`Set-Cookie: id=25` tells us it's likely there are 25 other accounts 
`id=1` or `0` is probably the admin

The username and password values are base64 and url-encoded.

We can try a few basic passwords to attempt to login as admin.
There is no lockout mechnaisms for attempts made.
This sets the stage if all else fails for a Brute Force attack 
but I want to return to the `login.php` and see what else we can do.

Session surfing with blind reflected XSS attack.
