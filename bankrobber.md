# BankRobber

This was my first box I ever attempted on HTB and it was active rated at insanse difficulty. So I thought I would put my skills to the ultimate test and see what I was made of. Took me about a week of late night excursions in total isolation while I worked my day job 9 to 5 until I was able to pop her. I liked this box a lot because it consisted of vulnerabilites that I already knew how to find and exploit.

### Reconnaissance

Well, so before any hack, you first must know what you are hacking. We know that this is a Windows box already from the description and can just as easily determine that with our next method.

Since HTB provides a IP address of our target. We can now run nmap a good old faithful tool that is almost as old as the internet itself. We set it to initate a SYN stealth scan and probe common TCP ports to discover some services on this box.

We see here that HTTP/s web services are available on this host at standard ports 80 and 443, a MYSQL database on 3306 as well as a open port on 445 standard SMB which is another way to determine the likelyness this is a Windows machine.

Since the name of the challenge is BankRobber, I think it is pretty safe to assume their is a bank involved. So lets load up our HTTP proxy burp suite and surf over to the web site and have a look-see at this Bank and see what she is made of.
